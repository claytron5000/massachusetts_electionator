# Electionator
An effort to scrape and display information about elections in a user friendly way.

## MVP
1. Address finder
 	> The mvp might be something like a simple address webform
2. Important Dates
 	> Upcoming election date
 	> Early voting dates
 	> Source as of yet unknown
 3. My Ballot tab
 	> The my Ballot tab displays the meat and potatoes of the site. This includes Initiatives, Resolutions, and Candidates. For the moment, I'm calling these three content types.

## Content Types
#### Candidate
- Data Source
	- Depends on Level (ie State versus Congress)
- Title(name)
- Image
- Blurb
- Office
- Level
- Party
- Endorsements
- Incumbency
- Voting Record
- On Current Events
#### Ballot Initiative
- Title
- Blurb
- Full Text
- Endoresements
- "For and Against" arguments? Sometimes these are available on the actual ballot.
#### Resolutions
- Are these the laws that are passed by the General Court? I.e. Massachusetts state laws? I'm a little unclear what these would point to.
